A data grid/table component that helps you design data grids with real data. This is a proof of concept based on [react-table](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table). It only scratches the surface of what's possible, but it seems already useful!

# Supported features
- Import JSON and CSV files
- Customize many table properties such as font sizes, colors, dividers, borders, padding, gap.
- Multiple presets (as different components)
- Advanced customization via Overrides
