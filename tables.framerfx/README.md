A data grid/table component that helps you design data grids with real data. This is a proof of concept based on [react-table](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table). It only scratches the surface of what's possible, but it seems already useful!

# Tutorials
See [this post](https://learnreact.design/2020/02/08/design-data-tables-with-real-tables-part-1).

# Supported features
- Import JSON and CSV files
- Customize many table properties such as font sizes, colors, dividers, borders, padding, gap.
- Multiple presets (as different components)
- Advanced customization via Overrides
- Pagination

# Possible future features
Like I said, the current version of this package only scratches the surface of what's possible.

In addition to more controls for the styles, an exciting possibility is that we can make the table interactive!

- Sticky header and columns
- Sorting
- Resizing columns
- Filtering
- ..., basically anything supported by react-table is a possibility
